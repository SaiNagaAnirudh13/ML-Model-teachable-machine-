# ML-Model-teachable-machine-

This machine learning model was trained using Teachable Machine to identify four objects: a pillow , a bottle, a handbag , a mobile phone, and a cup. The model was trained on a small dataset of images of each object, captured using a webcam.

To use the model, simply show the object of interest to the webcam. The model will then output a probability score for each of the four objects. The object with the highest probability score is the object that the model believes is being shown.

This model can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Building a simple object recognition system
Creating a game or interactive experience
Automating tasks such as sorting objects or detecting defects
